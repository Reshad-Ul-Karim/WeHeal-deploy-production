# Real-Time Map Tracking for Emergency Ambulance System

## Overview

The emergency ambulance system now includes real-time map tracking between drivers and patients using free map APIs (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap). This allows both parties to see each other's locations on an interactive map during an emergency request.

## Features

### üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Maps**
- Real-time location tracking between driver and patient
- OpenStreetMap integration (completely free)
- Custom markers for ambulance and patient locations
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### üìç **Location Sharing**
- Permission-based location sharing
- Automatic location updates every 3-5 seconds
- Offline support with location queuing
- Privacy controls for users

### üö® **Emergency Features**
- Distance and ETA calculations
- Route display with turn-by-turn directions
- One-click navigation to external maps
- Emergency contact quick access

## How It Works

### 1. **Request Flow**
1. Patient creates emergency request
2. Driver accepts the request
3. Both parties are prompted for location sharing permission
4. Real-time tracking begins automatically

### 2. **Location Sharing**
- Uses browser's geolocation API
- Encrypts location data in transit
- Stores minimal location history
- Automatically stops when emergency ends

### 3. **Map Display**
- Shows both driver and patient locations
- Updates markers in real-time
- Displays route between locations
- Shows distance and estimated arrival time

## User Guide

### For Patients

1. **Create Emergency Request**
   - Fill out emergency form
   - Submit request

2. **When Driver Accepts**
   - You'll see driver information
   - Map will appear showing tracking option
   - Click "Share My Location" to enable tracking

3. **Real-Time Tracking**
   - See driver's ambulance location on map
   - View estimated arrival time
   - Contact driver directly if needed

### For Drivers

1. **Accept Emergency Request**
   - View request details
   - Click "Accept" button

2. **Start Location Sharing**
   - Map appears with tracking controls
   - Click "Start Sharing Location" to begin
   - See patient location once they share

3. **Navigate to Patient**
   - Use built-in map for reference
   - Click navigation button to open external maps
   - Update status as you progress

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
```javascript
// New socket events added:
- 'location:request-permission'
- 'location:grant-permission'
- 'location:update'
- 'location:received'
- 'location:tracking-active'
```

### Frontend Components
```javascript
// New map components:
- BaseMap.js - Core map functionality
- DriverTrackingMap.js - Driver-specific map
- PatientTrackingMap.js - Patient-specific map
- LocationMarker.js - Custom markers
- RouteDisplay.js - Route visualization
```

### Services
```javascript
// New services:
- geolocationService.js - Browser location API
- routeService.js - Route calculation
- offlineMapService.js - Offline support
```

## Privacy & Security

### üîí **Privacy Controls**
- Explicit permission required for location sharing
- Location sharing automatically expires
- No persistent location storage
- Emergency override options

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**
- Encrypted WebSocket connections
- Location data validation
- Rate limiting for location updates
- Automatic cleanup of old data

### üì± **Offline Support**
- Cached map tiles for offline viewing
- Queued location updates
- Automatic sync when online
- Fallback distance calculations

## Browser Compatibility

### ‚úÖ **Supported**
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### üìã **Requirements**
- HTTPS connection (required for geolocation)
- WebSocket support
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: OpenRouteService API key for enhanced routing
REACT_APP_OPENROUTE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Map Settings
- Default center: New York City
- Zoom levels: 1-19
- Tile server: OpenStreetMap
- Update frequency: 3-5 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Location Not Working**
   - Ensure HTTPS connection
   - Check browser location permissions
   - Verify WebSocket connection

2. **Maps Not Loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify leaflet/react-leaflet installation
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Real-Time Updates Missing**
   - Confirm WebSocket connection
   - Check location sharing permissions
   - Verify both parties accepted tracking

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Location permission denied" | Enable location in browser settings |
| "WebSocket connection failed" | Check network connection |
| "Map tiles not loading" | Check internet connectivity |

## Performance Optimization

### üöÄ **Best Practices**
