## Database Changes

### New Model: LabTestReport
```javascript
{
  reportId: String (unique),
  patientId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  doctorId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  testName: String,
  testCategory: String (enum: ['lab-test']),
  testDetails: {
    testType: String,
    sampleType: String,
    preparationInstructions: String,
    reportDeliveryTime: String
  },
  orderDate: Date,
  testDate: Date,
  status: String (enum: ['ordered', 'sample-collected', 'processing', 'completed', 'cancelled']),
  reportStatus: String (enum: ['pending', 'ready', 'not-available']),
  reportFile: String,
  reportUrl: String,
  reportGeneratedDate: Date,
  notes: String,
  price: Number,
  paymentStatus: String (enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'failed'])
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Lab Test Reports
- `GET /api/lab-tests/patient/tests` - Get patient's lab tests
- `GET /api/lab-tests/patient/reports` - Get patient's lab reports
- `POST /api/lab-tests/patient/order` - Create lab test order
- `PUT /api/lab-tests/:reportId/status` - Update lab test status (admin/doctor)

## Patient Dashboard Changes

### Marketplace Section
- The "Lab Tests" button in the patient dashboard now redirects to `/lab-tests` instead of `/marketplace/category/lab-test`
- This provides a more focused experience for lab test ordering

## Order Processing Changes

### Enhanced Order Controller
- Automatically creates lab test report entries when lab tests are ordered
- Different delivery estimates for lab tests (2 days) vs medicines (7 days)
- No stock reduction for lab tests (since they're services, not physical products)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The new model will be automatically created when the application starts. No manual database setup is required.

### 2. Add Sample Data (Optional)
To test the functionality with sample data, run:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/addSampleLabTestReports.js
```

This will create sample lab test reports for the first patient in your database.

### 3. Testing the Features

#### For Patients:
1. Login as a patient
2. Go to Dashboard â†’ Marketplace
3. Click on "Lab Tests" button
4. Browse lab tests and add to cart
5. Complete checkout
6. View "My Lab Tests" to see order status
7. View "My Reports" to see completed reports

#### For Admins/Doctors:
1. Use the API endpoint to update lab test status:
```bash
PUT /api/lab-tests/:reportId/status
{
  "status": "completed",
  "reportStatus": "ready",
  "reportUrl": "https://example.com/report.pdf",
  "reportGeneratedDate": "2024-01-17T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## File Structure

## Future Enhancements

5. **Report Sharing**: Allow patients to share reports with doctors
6. **Analytics**: Add analytics for lab test trends and usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **No lab tests showing**: Make sure you have lab test products in the database
2. **API errors**: Check that the lab test routes are properly added to server.js
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure the user has the correct role (Patient for viewing, Doctor/Admin for updating)

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server logs for API errors
3. Verify database connections
4. Ensure all routes are properly configured
